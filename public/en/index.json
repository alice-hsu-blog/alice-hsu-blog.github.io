I recorded them on my Yamaha P525, planning to leave the idea for later. But the melody kept looping in my mind—I just couldn’t stop hearing it. So I decided to finish the piece over the next few days.\nThe title Bell came naturally: during composition, I realized the melody carried a kind of “bell-like” resonance, so I named it accordingly.\nOn Composition Section A (mm. 1–22) Most of section A was born directly from improvisation on the piano.\nmm. 17–20: The melody in measures 17–18 is a variation of the opening measure, reminding listeners of the piece’s main motif. Measures 19–20 imitate the previous two measures but shift the register to create an echoing bell effect. Section B (mm. 23–54) Section B mainly develops materials from section A.\nmm. 23–26: Here, the main melody is transferred to the left hand—an inversion of the first four measures from section A. The right-hand line, meanwhile, augments the same material, slightly adjusting pitch direction to lead the musical flow. mm. 27–30: This passage mirrors measures 9–12 from section A. To be honest, this part (measures 23–30) didn’t exist at first—section B originally began at measure 31. Later, I felt the piece needed more buildup before reaching the climax, so I added this transition. To make it more engaging, I deliberately varied the melodic contour and chord progression to create more contrast and dialogue. I ended up liking how it turned out.\nmm. 39–42: This short passage connects the previous part to the coming climax. mm. 43–47: Here comes the climax. Initially, I tried to mirror the left hand of measures 1–4 in the right hand, but it didn’t quite work. So I reimagined the right-hand melody by harmonizing directly from the left-hand notes—and that became the core of this passage. mm. 49–54: To create a bell-like resonance, I wrote the left hand to play an octave on the first beat, then immediately leap to the higher register for the remaining beats. It’s a bit tricky to play but produces a shimmering echo effect. Section A’ (mm. 55–74) Since I loved the sound of the first eight measures so much, I wanted to bring them back—so I structured the piece as A–B–A’. That way, listeners can revisit the opening melody one more time.\nmm. 63–70: The right hand repeats the same melody from the beginning, but I changed the left-hand accompaniment for more harmonic tension. Instead of the original root-position A-flat arpeggio, I used a second inversion to evoke a sense of “the music coming to an end.”\nIn classical harmony, it’s common to hear the cadential progression $\\mathrm{I}^6_4 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{V}^7 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{I}$ near the conclusion, and I borrowed that pattern for this part. On Performance This section isn’t meant to prescribe how the piece should be played—just sharing what I think sounds nice. Feel free to explore your own interpretation and to email me your thoughts!\nPedaling The pedal plays a key role in this piece. I didn’t mark every pedal symbol on the score. That would make it too cluttered. And of course, I fully welcome performers to interpret pedaling differently.\nOne spot worth mentioning is measure 16, where I hold the pedal through the E♭ on the second beat and only change it at measure 19. This creates a bell-like resonance—two tones overlapping and shimmering together, much like how real bells ring in the air. (The same applies at measure 70 in the bass note.)\nFor measures 23–26, I intentionally avoid using pedal so the section feels clean and distinct from what came before.\nTone Color This piece was originally written for the piano, but I later discovered that the “Stage E. Piano” sound on my Yamaha P525 fits this piece beautifully—it almost feels like background music from a game. I recorded a new version with that tone and loved the result.\nI also think it might sound lovely on a glockenspiel or other bell-like instruments. If you find another sound that suits the piece, I’d love to hear about it!\nConclusion Before writing this post, I asked ChatGPT for topic suggestions related to composition. It not only gave me topics but also some hilariously overly poetic lines. Here are a few:\n“Sometimes I get stuck between two notes—it’s like words on the tip of my tongue that I can’t say.” $\\rightarrow$ I mean, yes, I do get stuck—but that metaphor is a bit too much. “When I played the final note, I suddenly felt the piece no longer belonged to me.” $\\rightarrow$ Nope. It still does! My name’s right there on the copyright page. “Every composition is a letter to a moment in time.” $\\rightarrow$ Wow, that’s\u0026hellip; dramatic. Sounds like something out of a romance novel. So instead of following ChatGPT’s flowery advice, I decided to just write plainly—honestly recording my thoughts during the creative process.\nIf you’ve performed this piece, I’d love to hear your version!

Six years later, I not only deleted the apps but also permanently deleted my Instagram account, and I often keep my Facebook account deactivated. Looking back now, I truly feel that my past self had taken an excellent first step.\nI joined Facebook in 2009 and have been using it for almost ten years now.\nOver the years, the changes have been dramatic. It started with just a few friends playing Happy Farm together, but soon exploded into over 400 friends (I know it’s still considered “few” by some people) flooding my feed. Not only my elementary school teachers, but even distant relatives and aunts I barely knew started adding me as a Facebook friend. My friend list became a strange mix of familiar yet unfamiliar people, and before long, I turned into a lurker, quietly scrolling through everyone’s updates.\nWhen posting on Facebook became too full of worries and self-consciousness, I shifted my focus to Instagram, where I created a small space of freedom to write. Sometimes, after viewing someone’s story, I’d respond with a heart-eyes emoji—just let them know I cared.\nYet, I found myself becoming more and more unhappy.\nI would often think, “That post was actually pretty good. Why didn’t he/she like it?” Or when I was tired from writing assignments and wanted to relax by browsing social media, I’d see a classmate from the same course posting a big update celebrating that they’d finished theirs, which made me more anxious.\nMoreover, I also came to realize that the people who truly matter in my life—family, close friends, mentors—are barely active on social media at all. My most precious memories with them don’t come from likes on a post, but from real moments: laughing together in sync, or being hugged and comforted when I was sad, safe enough to cry in their arms.\nIt wasn’t until yesterday that I fully realized this. I made up my mind and posted on both Facebook and Instagram, announcing I’d disappear from the platforms for a month. I would still keep Messenger and Line, but turn off phone notifications. That way, I wouldn’t be “on-call” all the time; instead, I’d check messages and reply only once a day.\nThen, I carried out the following steps in one go:\nStep 1: Remove temptation. I deleted the Facebook and Instagram apps from my phone.\nStep 2: Block access. I installed the “Block Site” extension on Chrome and added Facebook and Instagram to the block list.\nStep 3: Find alternative entertainment. Whenever I felt the urge to check social media, I redirected my attention to more productive activities, like coloring for relaxation, listening to music, reading, or writing.\nStep 4: Seek support. I asked friends from church to pray for me, and I talked with family and mentors, who praised and encouraged me—boosting my confidence.\nI originally thought I’d need sheer willpower to resist, but to my surprise, it felt much easier than expected. After just one day, I noticed some significant changes:\nMy mood felt lighter. No more waiting for “who hasn’t liked my post yet” and no more compulsive urge to clear red notification badges. It felt like pressing Ctrl+Shift+Esc to open my brain’s Task Manager and shutting down background apps of social media. Suddenly, I had so much more mental capacity freed up—enough to focus on meaningful things with ease instead of circling anxiously in the same place.\nMy senses have become sharper. Things I never noticed before began to stand out. With my eyes off the phone screen, I was no longer a passive receiver being flooded with information, but an active, curious explorer of the world. The colors of real life became sharper, and I even became more sensitive to subtle things: the perfect humidity of the breeze brushing against my face, like the cool freshness of a face mask just applied. Drinking water no longer feels difficult. (This may relate to the second point) This is a surprising change. I usually love sweet drinks, and recently I’ve been struggling to cut down. But today, something shifted. I became more sensitive to the taste of water. Drinks that I usually had, even mildly sweetened, suddenly felt cloying. I didn’t want them anymore. Instead, I began to enjoy the pure taste of water.\nAt the end of the day, my feeling was this: Ah! Relief! Quitting Facebook and Instagram on the first day felt like the sky finally broke into a heavy downpour after being stuffy and humid for too long. My heart was leaping with joy. I could sense that the parts of me dulled or weakened by social media were slowly, step by step, coming back to life.\n","title":"What Happened When I Deleted My Facebook and Instagram App?"}],"tags":[]}
