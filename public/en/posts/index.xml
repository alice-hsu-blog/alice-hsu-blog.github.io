      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following post was originally published on Medium on April 5, 2019. Six years later, I not only deleted the apps but also permanently deleted my Instagram account, and I often keep my Facebook account deactivated. Looking back now, I truly feel that my past self had taken an excellent first step.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I joined Facebook in 2009 and have been using it for almost ten years now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, the changes have been dramatic. It started with just a few friends playing Happy Farm together, but soon exploded into over 400 friends (I know it’s still considered “few” by some people) flooding my feed. Not only my elementary school teachers, but even distant relatives and aunts I barely knew started adding me as a Facebook friend. My friend list became a strange mix of familiar yet unfamiliar people, and before long, I turned into a lurker, quietly scrolling through everyone’s updates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
